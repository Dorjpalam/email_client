CAUTION: EMAIL ID AND PASSWORD GETS STORED IN A HUMAN-READABLE TEXT FILE!!

This is a basic email client written in python.

This code was written as a part of a mini-project. Many thanks to all team members!

The features include:
- adding multiple email ids
- priority email: a button on the left allows you to add email ids, when mails are recd from these ids,
they are also shown in the first tab (marked 'priority email')


Things which need work:
- email id and password are stored in simple text file, which of course is a major security concern.
- code doesn't work great if the email account has heavy "traffic"
